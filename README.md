If you came across vulnerabilities in our code, or you want to flag other security-related concerns, please follow the security protocol detailed [here](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## Who we are?

Learn more about the NEAR Protocol in [the Beginner's Guide](https://near.org/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-the-near-blockchain/). At a high level, NEAR is a permissionless, Proof-of-Stake blockchain protocol that anyone can access, add transactions to, or read from. The public NEAR blockchain is an instantiation of the reference code at http://github.com/near/nearcore, but theoretically, this repo could be forked and deployed as a separate chain, as much as many protocols have done to build upon the core Bitcoin code.

#### The NEAR Foundation
A [non-profit foundation](https://near.org/blog/introducing-the-near-foundation/) headquartered in Switzerland which is responsible for contracting protocol maintainers, funding ecosystem development, and shepherding core governance of the protocol.
