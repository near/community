# Contract Runtime Work Group Agenda and Notes
This thread contains agenda and/or summary of the regular Contract Runtime sync meeting. Please propose agenda items through the PRs and Issues.

The scope of the contract runtime is the following:
* Wasm execution on the host:
  * Wasm VM and glue code around Wasmer+singlepass;
  * Code preparation tools, like gas injection and static checks;
  * Approaches to efficient caching of compilation;
* Gas metering:
  * How to make it faster while keeping safety;
  * Platform-independent gas fees estimation for Wasm operations;
* Host-guest interfacing:
  * How to pass complex structures efficiently between host and guest;
  * Contract-language specific mechanisms, e.g. Rust/AssemblyScript glue code needed to communicate across boundary;
* Rust/AssemblyScript to Wasm compilation:
  * Hiding low-level Wasm and glue code behind high-level contract interface. E.g. macros for Rust, compiler hooks for AssemblyScript;
  * Language-specific structure of the contract, how developers indicate contract methods, contract state, etc;
  * Best practices and the guidelines for contract development and compilation. Guidelines for optimizing contract for: Wasm size, gas usage, safety.

Short- and medium-term goal: Safe and highly performant contract execution runtime for Near;
Long-term goal: Near-independent and non-specific to Near contract execution runtime for general blockchains.

  * Bo and Eugene is looking on estimator panic/hang
  * Bo debugging contract execution crash/misbehavior

    view calls or force precompilation on deployment across nodes (discuss with @frol or Misha)
  * Willem switched Rust/QEMU interface from inline asm to read syscall (3533)

## 05.11.2020

### Status

  * Finally got contract caching merged, few follow ups from Eugene and Bowen; Bowen resolved issue with migration
  * Contract caching PR also disable single-threaded mode of RocksDB, as non-functional
  * Bo will take a look on estimator run hang (with Eugene)
  * Willem's effort of compiling with stable Rust: dynasm and one inline asm in our Rust code: replaced inline asm with Rust operation
  * Willem: simulation testing wrapped up
  * Working on Contract Runtime WG OKRs: 80% done
  * Not much changed in memory growth cost
  * Wasmer memory leak wasn't reproducible, Piotr created an issue amnd let's see if could reproduce it
  * Wasmer planning no more 0.x releases, but could accept our patches to those branches
  * Eugene: we have P0 issue with RPC view calls not able to mutate compiled contracts cache: we could either mutate cache in 
    view calls or force precompilation on deployment across nodes (discuss with @frol or Misha)

## 29.10.2020

### Status

* Contract caching needs final approval from Evgeny
* Willem working on compiling Wasmer (and nearcore) with stable Rust: dynasm dependency of Wasmer need to be promoted, 
 lightbeam in Wasmtime seems to require nightly
* Nikolay performed first cost coefficient computations in https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/3483, further
* Bo estimated EVM costs on multiple machines: results are stable
* Bo fixed EcRecover for EVM bridge
* Bo helping to look at Wasmer memory leak at https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/3402
* Wasmtime depends on Lightbeam, which depends on static_vec, which doesn't work in Stable; To check if could use other backend, or could 
  use regular vec, and use own fork on Wasmtime.


## 22.10.2020

### Status

* Nikolay got cached contracts work close to the end: caching is working, key is Wasm code hash + VMConfig hash, we cache both code or compilation error
* Eugene made experiment with 10M contracts on SSD and RAM drive: no difference in measured data as expected
* Need to disable single threaded mode, as otherwise estimator cannot proceed
* Willem built vmrunner using Wasmer with dynasm dependency modified to not depend on nightly, and built with stable Rust (1.47), seems be the way to build
  nearcore with Stable, unless there are other deps
* Getting rid of in-memory caches for contracts Wasm bytes
* Test runner can run most contracts, can test cross-contract calls
* Eugene suggests to introduce feature discriminating actual contract compilation for deployment vs. tests running in Near SDK (now we check target platform)
* Bo corrected few costs where EVM interpreter wasn't started. EVM costs are now stable and PR is finalized and ready to land.
* Willem written the contract to measure memory growth cost, not yet integrated it into estimator
* Willem implemented ability to see all execution outcomes coming from a transaction

## 15.10.2020

### Status

* Nikolay implemented IO measurement mechanism in QEMU plugin
* Applied IO measurement tool to the genesis tool to see if dependency is linear, seems to be so up to 1M contracts
* Merged Bo's contract cache effort into Nikolay's PR
* `cargo test --all` mostly passes with caches, modulo transactioncs per second tests
* Bo did EVM cost estimation: machinery is mostly done, but function calls pretty volatile ~20%, other more stable ~3%
* Willem got testing infra basically working: including cross-contract calls
* Failed promises are not properly handled by the standalone runtime, to be fixed

TODO: Willem to complete memory growth cost computations

TODO: Willem to add ability to see all execution outcomes coming from a transaction

## 08.10.2020

### Status

* Willem working on memory growth cost computations, basing on insn count as function of requested amount of memory
* Macroses for the testing infra almost there: only final testing remaining
* Caching precompiled contracts. We need to decide on how to cache data: runtime shall be independent of DB service. Cache shall be
 trait on its own, not store trait. Shall cache be singleton, or explicitly passed to the runtime? We shall pass it to runtime's constructor.
* EVM cost volatility investigation: cost deploy varies, will increase number of contracts. EVM cost is not always linear from NEAR computed cost.
* Netlink approach for disk IO counting seems to work: so could use if for gas estimation
* Evgeny figured out RocksDB issue with huge number of contracts: as we disabled multiple threads, DB cannot flush the data without the background


## 01.10.2020

### Status
* Bo, did some work on volatility of the EVM cost, but haven't finished it yet. Make evm now count cost in the same way as near function calls (included cost to finalized block, deduct action receipt cost), it's more expensive than previously just counting function run_evm, in one number get can do 660 tps erc20 transfer under current block gas limit;
* Willem did a talk on wasm vs EVM on Friday that went well.  And the latest generation of the simulation testing now compiles, but it is just the hand crafted version so still need to turn it into a macro;

## 24.09.2020
### Status
* Nikolay Igotti is OOO this week.
* Precompilation with on-disk cache. Bo made a pull request for on-disk cache for precompilation, but Misha and Bowen are discussing what is the right way to do it. It currently uses Singleton. Misha suggested to do it from trie update by exposing store. Eugene suggests to introduce Singleton cache, which would also make it relatively easy to disable, we might also get rid of the `cached_key!` macroses, which are already hard to disable because we need to use 
compiler flags. We should address `cached_key!` later;

* Contract testing infra. Waiting on the next round of feedback from Chad and incorporated feedback from Illia. Trying to make it work without macros first. Not blocked on it though.

* Willem talked to Matt and created an AssemblyScript stripped down example to compare it to a similar EVM contract.

* Wasmer 1.0. We are waiting for Syrus to provide documentation on error handling.

* EVM fees counting are having some issues that Bo is working on. After Illia introduced new changes the code needs to be updated.
## 17.09.2020
### Status

* Willem: address feedback for contract testing infra for cross-contract calls
* Willem: to take a look at https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore/issues/3120 https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore/issues/3122
* Bo + Nikolay + Evgeny: next step is to use database to store complied contracts, compile on deploy and recompute the fees
* Nikolay: evaluate approaches to accounting IO costs in gas price (3-4 days), discuss with Evgeny and Mikhail

## 10.09.2020
### Status
* Combined runner is functional, but we have certain conceptual discussions around, and not sure if going to merge
* Bo encountered issues with error mapping in Wasmer 1.0 alpha, no luck with running the runtime so far

     * raises the issue of testability and test coverage
     * decided as the next steps to focus on contract testability in standalone environment
     * Parity uses common crates to replace std collectors and allocations, cannot use dynamic strings
     * Compute contract size profile on every run of CI
 * Contract are similar to serverless functions/lambdas, and could provide REST APIs and use that for testing and deployment
 * @Max: we need to finish the standalone runtime for testing and contracts with REST APIs (Ganache from Etherium does the same)
 * Polish up devx story with testing/deployment: Vlad F., Evgeny, Willem, Alex F., focus for upcoming few months (Mocknet project could be similar)
     
Action item:  (Willem) set up cloud agent for cost param estimator

## 16.07.2020
### Status:
* Param estimator and threading: we cannot controil threads via Rust APIs, with C++ APIs there are more control, but still thread get created
  Resolution: estimate conservatively by upper bound, and get back after Phase 1, maybe by contributing to Rocks DB. Also consider disabling Rocks 
  DB cache during contract run.
* Contract size reduction:
   * looking at no-std mode. It requires serios SDK rework, and also we need to make sure no std functions used in contracts. Bo is looking at Parity, which uses no-std for contracts.  
   * Willem found that twiggy is rather good contract size profiler, shows top functions pretty well if names section is not stripped
   * from analysis with twiggy we found that significant part of many contracts is float to string convertor
   * Nikolay is looking at removing known unused functions with wasm-snip tool
   * Willem fixed twiggy to work with AssemblyScript
   * In AssemblyScript files string formatters are big as well
   * With Rust generics could be pretty big as well
   * Bo did currect example contracts size from Rust SDK run on CI
   
 Action item: look at nanoserde
 Vlad F: reproducability issues with Docker, hash maps make it less reproducible


## 26.06.2020

### Status report
* Nikolay Igotti: multi-VM support was merged, and we made it compilation-time dependency. Eventually this feature will become default, to make sure it does not break;
* Nikolay Igotti: There was a debug print out by Wasmer, we asked them to publish the version without it `0.17.1`. Nikolay Igotti will switch runtime to this version;
* Nikolay Igotti: Wasmer provided us with the access to the new `1.0` version, currently it is not published to crates.io yet;
* Nikolay Igotti: We postponed the whiteboard session with Runtime Verification to next Wednesday;
* Willem Wyndham: implemented the contract loading fee, but there is an issue with param estimator, see transaction runtiem meeting;

### Future focus
* Decrease the executable size. We will look at `no-std/alloc` for Rust API, and we will look at nanoserde. Also Nikolay Igotti contacted an independent security researcher to help us debug the size of the contract;

### Notes
* Max Zavershynskyi -- we need a docker image for building contracts. Might reuse the cost estimation image. Ask Bo Yao to push the image to our Docker hub. Let's ask Sandi to help with it;
* Nikolay Igotti: we need to understand how to run the contracts with more than one VM;
* Bowen Wang: Fees (by Willem Wyndham) is blocking us on checking upgradability, which we need for Phase 1;
* Bowen Wang: On code readiness we will be ready by mid July, but there are many logistic components that were not addressed yet;
* Nikolay Igotti: Will also schedule a whiteboard session with Cosmwasm.

## 19.06.2020

### Status report
* Nikolay I: We now have a functional version of contract runtime that can either choose Wasmer or Wasmtime. There is however a problem with running Wasmtime and Wasmer tests concurrently, since Wasmer sets the global signal handler which sometimes intercepts Wasmtime errors. Wasmer might handle it in the future. Overall, it is feasible to run two runtimes. Unfortunately, Wasmtime brought dependencies that pulled cmake version which breaks our CI. We also need to decide the mechanism of selection of the runtime;
* Willem W (by Nikolay I): Progress in introducing cost of contract exeuction derived from teh sie of the contract.

### External communication
* Planning to have whiteboard sessions with Cosmwasm and Runtime Verification.

### Notes
* Bowen W: This seems to be high priority. We need to make sure the same source code compiles into the same Wasm code. This might be urgent, to make sure our users can verify that given Wasm was compiled from the given source code. Vlad F: It seems Rust is already byte to byte reproducible for Wasm compilation. Max Z: We need to have a docker build image;
* Max Z: We might need to put more effort into reducing the contract size. We shoudl explore `no-std` mode for `near-sdk-rs`. Vlad F: there is https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/ crate that provides all collections and primitives for `no-std` mode in Rust. Alexey F: Regarding Willem's proposal to have std as a hardcoded Wasm library that we link against, it is not clear what will be the overhead of calling it using host functions. Evgeny K: We are using `-z` option which is supposed to reduce the size but for Wasm `-s` is often better. There is also a lot of debug data that accounts for ~15% of code size. Max Z: Suggest to checkout https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/ which is a guide to writing no-std Rust;

## 12.06.2020

### Status report
* Willem W: Added two new fees to the config: cost of loading in the contract, cost of compiling the contract. Max Z: suggestion: base cost of compilation/loading, cost of compilation/loading per byte;
* Nikolay I: Experimented with adding Wasmtime, had some issues with host functions. Max Z: AFAIK Nikolay I was able to work around the lack of unsigned numbers in Wasmtime.
* Willem W: Finally tied version of AssemblySript to near-sdk-as. We will now better reproducibility for the contracts. Batch promises were added. We currently have UnorderedMap (no specific order guarantees, because of the internal swapping). We will have OrderedMap (based on AVL). Max Z: Suggestion, let's have all collections that do not go into near-sdk-* in separate library/crate. Vlad F: let's have AssemblySript-like Map in near-sdk-rs, instead of direction operations with storage.
* Vlad F: There was a community discussion of the Debug trait in near-sdk-rs, that prevents people from autoimplementing Debug on user-defined types. Unfortunately, for collections Debug will fetch all items which is very expensive.
* Bowen W: there is a discrepancy between near-sdk-rs and master node.

Discussed adding releases and change log for: near-sdk-rs, near-sdk-as, borsh, runtime.


## 05.06.2020

### Current focus
* Adding another runtime -- Wasmtime to check consistency of Wasm execution. Nikolay I had a lot of progress prototyping binding Wasmtime with our node. Unfortunately, there is a critical bug in Wasmtime which prevents of calling our host functions. Wasmtime can only handle signed types in the their interface, while we use unsigned types. The integration seems to be feasible, so far. We need to understand how to do arguments passing and return values handling. As a side effect we are making our contract runtime Wasmer agnostic, e.g. we are not importing Wasmer dependencies.
* Cost estimation of contract invocation based on the contract size (see https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/chainmiddleware-5cea2bcf78297c385cf0ec81/issues/nearprotocol/nearcore/2778);
* Nikolay I finished FAQ for contract runtime. Currently blocked by Max Z.

### Status update
* Nikolay I: Discussed with Willem how to split their current work items.
* Willem W: Pushed changes to aspect. Met with DevX team and brainstormed various projects we can set bounties for, e.g. add `include_bytes` into AssemblyScript. Started writing issues for the bounties and started looking into adding the fee.

### Note
* Evgeny K: Wasmer actually casts unsigned integers to signed behind the scenes, btw;
* Nikolay I: Wasmer thinking about providing interface to wrap other runtimes consistent with their interface.
* Alexey F: How about fusing Wasmer and Wasmtime and run both for each contract execution? Nikolay I: We might run it at a special mode. We might not even take a hit on TPS because it is very parallelizable.
* Willem W: Can we run V8 safely? Nikolay I: He might be the most familiar with V8, but it might not be easy to embed.
* Nikolay I: We should fuzz these machines. Max Z: We can repurpose fuzzers that some security audit companies provided for us.
* Bowen W: Bowen talked about contract migration with Dev X. The problem statement: user updates the contract code and they want to continue using the old state. Max Z: We might solve it by having rigorous best practices. Alexey F: We can constraint a bunch of stuff on near-sdk level. Evgeny K: We might do some work on near-sdk, e.g. we can include version of the contract into the key that we use to store the contract state. Nikolay I: Overall it might be hard to automate, because the translation is semantic in many cases.
